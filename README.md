### The problem

Climate change is affecting many sectors, and agriculture is definitely one of them. Due to the lack of knowledge, farmers are extensively using water, leading many developing countries to struggle with water depletion. Thus, it is crucial to educate farmers about using natural resources efficiently. However, the majority of the farmers worldwide are illiterate, making the process more complicated.


### Our solution

"Sensora" have many important features that will be one of the important steps of solving the problem addressed above. It can aggregate information about the soil moisture and temperature from the sensors installed in the field. Then, it will analyze the information and convey the result to the farmers in human voice. 


### Built with

- [Liquid Prep](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/iot/projects/liquid-prep/) - to compute irrigation advice
- [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson) - to convert the result to speech

### About this repository

This repository contains the source code for computings being done at the station sensors. We used the open-source project, Liquid prep, for calculating the irrigation advice, and IBM Watson for conveying the results to the farmers both directly from the sensors and the app.
